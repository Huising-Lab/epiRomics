Description: A package designed to integrate various levels of epigenomic information, including, but not limited to ChIP and Histone next-generation sequencing. Regulatory network analysis can be done by using combinatory approaches to infer regions of significance, such as enhancers. Downstream analysis can identify co-occurance of epigenomic data located at regions of interest. Finally, this package allows for various results to be visualized. 
  This package is currently in development. Please contact <ammawla@ucdavis.edu> for suggestions, feedback, or bug reporting.

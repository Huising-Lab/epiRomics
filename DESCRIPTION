Description: A package designed to integrate various levels of epigenomic
    information, including, but not limited to ChIP and Histone
    next-generation sequencing. Regulatory network analysis can be done by
    using combinatory approaches to infer regions of significance, such as
    enhancers. Downstream analysis can identify co-occurance of epigenomic
    data located at regions of interest. Finally, this package allows for
    various results to be visualized.  This package is currently in
    development. Please contact <ammawla@ucdavis.edu> for suggestions,
    feedback, or bug reporting.
